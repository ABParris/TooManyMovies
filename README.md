# TooManyMovies
This repository holds a simple movie program that I made, as
well as an EasyReader class that I use quite often. If you 
would like to try the program RIGHT NOW, then just download
the .jar and the .txt and make sure they are in the same directory.

This program uses a default list with a tight idea of how
that list needs to look, so be cautious with the .txt file.

TooManyMovies can do the following:
1. Store movies in an ArrayList
2. Randomly choose an unwatched film
3. Keep track of whether a film has been watched
4. Add films to teh list
5. Delete films from the list

Future additions may include:
1. sub lists for movie series
2. Not relying on a .txt file to store information
3. Movie class that holds movie type and name
4. Using movie class to choose movie based on type
5. Adding GUI components to chhose desired film type
6. AI to look at films watched and pick the next film
   , or a list of films based on getting a full emotional
   roller coaster.
